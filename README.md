## I Am Rickras
   My name is Rickson de Oliveira Viana.
   
   I'd say I've been developing games for about 10 months (at the time of this readme).
  
   
   I was very happy with my result developing Pong, I believe it should have started like this from the beginning, but I won't regret it. I even remembered to upload to Git a little late,
but I made a procedural level generation system in this very cool game.

   This system has been my best so far, it generates a procedurally generated map divided into sections. Currently it just does that, it creates a map with the sections that I send and divides them randomly, I will now increase the generation of coins and enemies on it,
soon I'm going to make the parent script of everything choose between these 3 what each section will be, a section of coins, or enemies or obstacles.

I am very happy with my result and this will be another game that I proudly add to my portfolio.

## Project for 20 games challenge

### What is Challenge?
   The 20 Games Challenge is a fun way to gain confidence while learning to make video games.
   If you take a traditional art class, you might be asked to re-create a famous work. It might sound like a waste of time at first, but by copying a masterpiece, you will often gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals that you could gain by just “winging it.”

   Video games are one of the most complex art forms to date. Mastering the fundamentals of game development will take a lot of practice and patience. Many professional game developers will recommend making multiple small projects instead of starting with your “dream game.”

This challenge is my attempt to simplify the learning process for anyone who wants to start making their own video games
